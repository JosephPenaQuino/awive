    """Compute water flow using Manning's equation with depth profiles.

    This function calculates the water flow rate by integrating
    velocity profiles over the cross-sectional area of a river. It
    uses Manning's equation to model the vertical velocity distribution
    and applies a linear correction based on optimized coefficients.

    The vertical velocity profile follows: v(z) = v * (z/d)^(1/n)
    where z is the depth, d is the total depth, and n is the
    roughness coefficient.

    Args:
        depths: 2D array of shape (N, 2) where each row contains
            [depth, x_position]. First column represents the riverbed
            depth at each position along the width. Second column
            represents the x-coordinate along the river width.
        vels: 1D array of surface velocities corresponding to each
            depth measurement. Must have the same length as depths.
        old_depth: Reference water depth used during velocity
            measurements.
        roughness: Manning's roughness coefficient (n). Controls the
            shape of the vertical velocity profile.
        current_depth: Current water depth for which to compute the
            flow rate.
        a_coeff: Linear correction scaling coefficient. Default is
            0.646465 (optimized).
        b_coeff: Linear correction offset coefficient. Default is 9.95
            (optimized).

    Returns:
        float: Computed water flow rate in cubic meters per second
            (m³/s), after applying the linear correction:
            a_coeff * flow + b_coeff.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If depths and vels arrays have different
            lengths.

    Note:
        The function adjusts depths based on the difference between
        current_depth and old_depth, and sets negative depths to zero.
        The final flow rate is computed by integrating the velocity
        profile over the entire cross-section.
